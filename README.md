# Online Application Form

This project is a simple online application form that allows users to submit their details. The form includes fields for full name, email, phone number, date of birth, highest education, and address. The submitted data is processed and displayed in a new window.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the form.
- `process.php`: The PHP file that processes the form submission and displays the submitted data.
- `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file that handles form validation and AJAX submission.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the form and the success message.
